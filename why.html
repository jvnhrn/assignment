    <h1> WHY </h1>
    <p> For my Bachelor project I built a prototype for an app and website. During this project </br>
      it became clear to me that I want to work in the field of UX and UI. To better position myself in this area, </br>
      I want to learn how to not only design websites and apps, but also how to build them .</br>
      I want to understand all steps up to a finished product. I don't only want to design portotypes, </br>
      but also websites and apps that already work. I chose the Talent Garden Code Master Bootcamp for my further education, </br>
      because on the one hand I like the way the course is structured and on the other hand experts from </br>
      the field of Front End Development will teach the content. I was also very impressed by Talent Garden's claim that </br>
      the career of the students is in the foreground. I would like to specialise in UX and programming with this course. </br>
      I want to design user-oriented, economically responsible projects.
